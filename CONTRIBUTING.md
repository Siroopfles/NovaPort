# Contributing to the Nova System

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome improvements and new ideas. To ensure a smooth process, please follow these guidelines.

## Reporting Bugs or Issues

If you find a bug in the system prompts, workflows, or documentation, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

When reporting a bug, please include:

1.  **A clear and descriptive title.**
2.  **A detailed description of the problem:**
    *   Which agent mode (`nova-orchestrator`, `nova-leaddeveloper`, etc.) or workflow (`WF_... .md`) is affected?
    *   What did you expect to happen based on the prompt or workflow definition?
    *   What actually happened? Include any error messages or unexpected outputs.
3.  **Steps to Reproduce:** Provide a clear, step-by-step sequence of actions or user prompts that led to the issue. This is crucial for debugging the agent interactions.
4.  **Your Environment (if relevant):** The version of the execution framework (e.g., Roo Code) and the ConPort server you are using.

## Suggesting Enhancements or New Workflows

We are always open to new ideas for improving the system or adding new, useful workflows. Given the structured nature of the Nova system, enhancements often take the form of new standardized workflows.

When proposing an enhancement:

1.  **Open an issue** with a title that starts with "Enhancement:" or "Feature Request:".
2.  **Provide a clear description of the proposed change:**
    *   **The "Why":** Explain the problem or limitation you're trying to solve. What capability is the system currently missing?
    *   **The "What":** Describe the change in detail. If it's a new workflow, outline its goal, primary actors (e.g., `Nova-Orchestrator` delegating to `Nova-LeadQA`), and the key phases or steps involved. Consider how it would interact with ConPort.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Discuss how this change might affect existing modes or workflows. For example, a new workflow might require a minor clarification in a Lead Mode's system prompt.
    *   **Alternative Solutions:** If you've considered other ways to solve the problem, please mention them.

This structured approach helps us understand the full context of your proposal and have a productive discussion.

Thank you for helping make the Nova System better!
