# Workflow: Basic Security Vulnerability Testing (WF_QA_SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_TESTING_BASIC_001_v1)

**Goal:** To perform a basic set of automated and/or checklist-based security vulnerability scans to identify common vulnerabilities. This is a preliminary check, not a full penetration test.

**Primary Actor:** Nova-LeadQA
**Primary Specialist Actor:** Nova-SpecializedTestExecutor

**Trigger / Recognition:**

- `Nova-Orchestrator` delegates: "Perform basic security scan for [Application/Module]".
- Part of `WF_QA_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_VALIDATION_001_v1.md`.
- A periodic scan is triggered by `NovaSystemConfig`.

**Pre-requisites by Nova-LeadQA:**

- An application build is deployed to an isolated test environment.
- Security checklists and automated scanner tool commands are defined in `ProjectConfig`.

**Reference Milestones for your Single-Step Loop:**

**Milestone SVT.1: Scan Execution**

- **Goal:** Execute both automated and manual security checks against the target application.
- **Suggested Specialist Sequence & Briefing Guidance:**
  1.  **LeadQA Action:** Log a main `Progress` item for this security scan cycle and a `Decision` to begin.
  2.  **Delegate to `Nova-SpecializedTestExecutor` (Automated Scans):**
      - **Subtask Goal:** "Execute automated security scans (e.g., ZAP, Bandit, pip-audit) against [TargetApplicationURL]."
      - **Briefing Details:**
        - Provide the target URL and the list of tools to run.
        - Instruct to use commands from `ProjectConfig.security.tools`.
        - Specify scanner policies (e.g., passive scan only).
        - Raw reports should be saved to `.nova/reports/qa/security/`.
        - The specialist should return paths to reports and a summary of alert counts.
  3.  **Delegate to `Nova-SpecializedTestExecutor` (Manual Checklist):**
      - **Subtask Goal:** "Execute a manual security checklist review for key application areas."
      - **Briefing Details:**
        - Provide the ConPort key for the security checklist (from `ProjectConfig`).
        - Instruct to systematically review each item on the checklist and record pass/fail results with evidence for failures.
        - The specialist should return a structured list of their findings.

**Milestone SVT.2: Vulnerability Logging & Reporting**

- **Goal:** Analyze all findings, log credible vulnerabilities, and compile a final report.
- **Suggested Lead Action & Specialist Sequence:**
  1.  **LeadQA Action: Analyze & Triage:**
      - Consolidate all automated and manual findings.
      - Filter out likely false positives from scanners.
  2.  **Delegate to `Nova-SpecializedTestExecutor` (or self-action):**
      - **Subtask Goal:** "For each credible, unique vulnerability, log a new `ErrorLogs` item."
      - **Briefing Details:** Instruct to create detailed, R20-compliant `ErrorLogs` with a 'Security' category or tag. The `severity` should be set appropriately (e.g., HIGH, CRITICAL).
  3.  **LeadQA Action:** Coordinate update of `active_context.open_issues` via `Nova-Orchestrator`.
  4.  **Delegate to `Nova-SpecializedTestExecutor` (or ConPortSteward):**
      - **Subtask Goal:** "Compile a summary report for the basic security scan."
      - **Briefing Details:** Instruct to create a Markdown report summarizing the scope, tools used, findings, and a list of all new `ErrorLogs` keys created. This should be saved as a `TestExecutionReports` item in ConPort or as a file.
  5.  **LeadQA Action:** Finalize the cycle by updating the main `Progress` item and using `attempt_completion` to report the summary and any critical vulnerabilities to `Nova-Orchestrator`.

**Key ConPort Items Involved:**

- Progress (integer `id`)
- Decisions (integer `id`)
- CustomData ErrorLogs:[key] (key)
- CustomData TestExecutionReports:[key] (key)
- Reads `ProjectConfig` and `SecurityChecklists`.
